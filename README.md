# ALX Low-Level Programming

Welcome to the **ALX Low-Level Programming** repository. This repository contains various projects and exercises in C, covering fundamental concepts of programming, memory management, data structures, and algorithms. These projects are designed to build a deep understanding of how computer systems work at a low level, and provide hands-on experience with topics like pointers, memory allocation, file handling, linked lists, hash tables, recursion, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into folders representing different project topics and exercises:

### 0x00-hello_world

This project covers the basics of C programming, including compiling simple C programs, using `gcc`, understanding syntax, and printing output.

### 0x01-variables_if_else_while

This folder explores variable declaration, conditional statements (`if`...`else`), and loops (`while`, `for`). It focuses on control flow in C programs.

### 0x02-functions_nested_loops

Introduction to functions in C, scope, and using nested loops to solve problems. Topics include defining, declaring, and invoking functions.

### 0x03-debugging

Covers debugging techniques using tools like `gdb`, and applying strategies to identify and fix errors in C programs.

### 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops

Expands on functions and nested loops, focusing on solving more complex problems using efficient code.

### 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings

Introduction to pointers, arrays, and strings in C. Learn how to manipulate memory addresses and work with arrays of characters (strings).

### 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

Continuation of pointers, arrays, and strings, focusing on more complex operations like pointer arithmetic and string manipulation.

### 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

Final deep dive into pointers, arrays, and strings, covering multidimensional arrays and advanced pointer usage.

### 0x08-recursion

Explore the concept of recursion, where functions call themselves to solve problems, and learn how to apply it to common algorithmic tasks.

### 0x09-static_libraries

Learn how to create and use static libraries (`.a` files), which allow you to bundle code into reusable libraries in C.

### 0x0A-argc_argv

Focuses on handling command-line arguments (`argc`, `argv`) and writing programs that can process input from the command line.

### 0x0B-malloc_free

Introduction to dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`, `free`, and the concept of managing memory manually in C programs.

### 0x0C-more_malloc_free

Continues the topic of dynamic memory management, focusing on more complex use cases of `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.

### 0x0D-preprocessor

Learn about the C preprocessor, macros, and conditional compilation. This project covers how to use `#define`, `#include`, and other preprocessor directives.

### 0x0E-structures_typedef

Introduction to `struct` and `typedef` in C, used to group variables and define new data types.

### 0x0F-function_pointers

Learn about function pointers in C, and how to use them for callback functions, dynamic function execution, and creating flexible programs.

### 0x10-variadic_functions

Covers variadic functions, which allow a function to accept a variable number of arguments using the `stdarg` library in C.

### 0x12-singly_linked_lists

Explore singly linked lists, a dynamic data structure that allows for efficient memory usage and insertion/deletion of elements.

### 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists

Dive deeper into singly linked lists, solving more complex problems such as detecting loops, reversing lists, and more.

### 0x14-bit_manipulation

Learn about bitwise operations in C, which allow you to manipulate data at the bit level. This project covers AND, OR, XOR, bit shifting, and more.

### 0x15-file_io

Covers file input/output in C, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files using system calls.

### 0x17-doubly_linked_lists

Introduction to doubly linked lists, a data structure where each node has two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node.

### 0x18-dynamic_libraries

Learn how to create and use dynamic libraries (`.so` files) in C, allowing for shared code that can be loaded during runtime.

### 0x1A-hash_tables

Introduction to hash tables, a data structure that allows for efficient data retrieval using key-value pairs and hashing functions.

### 0x1C-makefiles

Learn how to create `Makefile`s, a build automation tool that helps manage project compilation by specifying rules for building executables.

### 0x1E-search_algorithms

Introduction to searching algorithms such as linear search, binary search, and other algorithms used to efficiently find elements in data structures.
